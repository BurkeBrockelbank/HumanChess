# HumanChess

HumanChess is a realistic chess AI built from the Lichess database.

## Introduction
Chess engines have surpassed humans long ago and are invaluable for checking positions and finding the best moves, but they are not good playing partners. Chess engines tend to play very strongly for several moves in a row and then make an obvious blunder. The more blunders, the easier it is to play against. The problem is that humans don't play like this.

The goal of the HumanChess project is to create an AI that will play convincingly like a human at any level of play. One that makes inaccuracies, mistakes, and blunders in a human way.
